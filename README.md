# Tolkiens_Legendarium
An attempt to collect all of tolkien's works into a single file for easier consumption.

Currently I'm working on "The Lord of te Rings", but this project will expand to include all of Tolkien's published works, including the silmarillion.

To build an application, you can compile either the assembly or the main C++ source file.
